# 🎮 Game Hacking 101 – Intro

## What is Game Hacking?
Game hacking is the process of modifying a game’s behavior to change how it works, usually to the player's advantage. Common examples include:
- Infinite health
- Unlimited resources (e.g., sun in PvZ)
- No cooldowns
- Auto collect or automation

## 🕹️ A Brief History
- **1980s–90s**: Game Genie / Action Replay used to patch console games.
- **PC Era**: Memory editors like Cheat Engine made hacking accessible.
- **Modern Times**: More advanced hacks like ESP, aimbots, packet injection, etc.

## 🔍 Types of Game Hacks
- **Memory Editing**: Change in-game values (health, ammo, sun).
- **Speedhacks**: Manipulate time or movement speed.
- **Aimbots / Wallhacks**: Automate or expose hidden info (multiplayer).
- **Packet Editing**: Modify network communication (advanced).
- **Modding**: Change or add new content (cosmetic or mechanical).
